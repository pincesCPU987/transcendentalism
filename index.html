      When practicing transcendentalism, you must be self-reliant. You must also be resistant to loneliness. Technology is usually the culprit for loneliness, but there are ways to appropriately use technology in the transcendentalist life. You should use technology to connect with only a handful of friends you cannot physically get to. If you can meet up with friends regularly, in real life, you should do that instead. This does not mean asking all of your Discord friends for their address and flying there. This means finding people in your community, in your school, at your job, etc. and connecting with them. This state of balanced friendship is key to transcendentalism because it enables the most stable life. On one hand, with too many friends, you will need them all of the time. On the other hand, in total isolation, you will go completely insane, as we are not a solitary species. Another way you should not use technology is to prompt others to do work for you. For example, ordering items on Amazon makes it so that you don't want to get the items yourself. In other words, it makes you lazy. Not only that, but there is a delay that, in the most crucial situations, may be a serious problem. If you order food online, it may not come to you before you starve or dehydrate. You must get the items you need yourself, or at least go somewhere where they are made, and prefer to barter. Money is an illusion; it has no real value. When you receive something with actual value, age-old etiquette suggests that you give something with equal value back. With inflation, money becomes a greater problem, as its value is not stable. If you need something done, you should not rely on technology to call others to come and do it for you. Finding a tutorial on YouTube is acceptable because you are not mitigating risk by doing nothing, but by simply finding out how to do it right. Another aspect of technology to look at is its scope. Technology does not simply include electronics and computers; it also includes the wheel, the lever, the screw, and other simple machines. These technologies have been around for much longer than today's electronics, and it is recommended that you use these.

      In Thoreau's text Walden, Thoreau did not feel lonely because he realized that he did not need other people or technology to keep him company. He describes the feeling that he "was suddenly sensible of such sweet and beneficent society in Nature." This means that only nature needs to keep him company.

      He claims that "we are...more lonely when we go abroad among men than when we stay in our chambers." This means that when we go looking for people to recreate with, we rely on their company too much and miss them when they are gone. On the other hand, he claims that "a man thinking or working is always alone...." This means that you can be alone, but only the people who seek company will be lonely. Therefore, using technology to seek company is bad for your health.
